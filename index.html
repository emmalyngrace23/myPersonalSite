            This is a skill that I acquired just recently but I have been so absorbed, diving into the world of coding.   I sleep every night thinking of how I could improve the websites I have created and wake up each morning ready commit myself into so much more learning!

          <h3>Marketing</h3>
          <p>I started selling as a kid. When I was in grade school, I'd sell snacks to my classmates. During high school and college days, I sold prepaid load to my friends. I barely spend my allowance because my small businesses' profit is enough to cover my expenses. That makes me a good saver, too! After graduating, I sold clothes, and watches, and even plants online. I was already working in the bank when I joined this multi-level marketing company and shared food supplements to my officemates and friends. I guess marketing is a natural part of me :) </p>
